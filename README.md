# PasswordGenerator

## Description
 - I added the function under assignment code to randomize the password from my set min/max.
 - I added a function to randomize the password in terms of special characters, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase.
 - I added a window prompt function causing the "Generate Password" button to ask how long the user would like the password.
 - I added window alerts allowing the user to understand why the action didn't work as expected.
 - I added a function allowing the user to confirm uppercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
 - I added a function now allowing the password to become only of what the user picks.
 - I added a function allowing the User to return to the default page after generating a password.
